Here’s a step-by-step, simplified guide to using Samsung IAP API to manage in-app purchases, including orders, publishing, and subscriptions.

1. Setup Samsung IAP in your project

Create a Samsung Developer Account: Sign up at Samsung Developers.

Register your app in the Samsung Galaxy Store:

Go to the “Seller Portal” and create your app.

Fill in basic app information.

You’ll need to upload an APK (even a basic one) to proceed.


Download Samsung IAP SDK: Integrate the SDK into your app to handle purchases.

If using Android Studio, import the SDK library into your project.



2. Configuring IAP for your app

Set up the necessary permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml:

<uses-permission android:name="com.samsung.android.iap.permission.BILLING" />

Add billing features in your code:

Use SamsungIapHelper class to start a purchase and handle payment response.

Ensure your app can detect when a purchase has been made, canceled, or refunded.



3. Types of Products Supported

Samsung IAP supports three types of products:

Consumables: Products that users can buy multiple times (e.g., game credits).

Non-consumables: Products that users buy once and own permanently (e.g., premium features).

Subscriptions: Recurring products billed over time (e.g., monthly subscriptions).


4. Create and Manage Products

Go to the Seller Portal > Your App > In-App Products section.

Create Products:

Set the product ID, type (consumable/non-consumable/subscription), and price.


Configure Subscriptions: For subscription products:

Choose the billing cycle (e.g., weekly, monthly).

Set the price and subscription duration.



5. Implementing Purchase Flow (For Orders)

Initialize the IAP Helper:

Add the necessary code to initialize Samsung IAP in your app:


SamsungIapHelper iapHelper = new SamsungIapHelper(this, SamsungIapHelper.IAP_MODE_PRODUCTION);
iapHelper.startPayment(productId);

Start the Purchase Process: When a user selects a product to buy, call the purchase method.

Handle Purchase Result: Implement listeners to handle successful or failed purchases:

iapHelper.setOnPaymentListener(new OnPaymentListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPaymentSuccess(IapResult result) {
        // Handle successful purchase
    }
    @Override
    public void onPaymentFailed(IapResult result) {
        // Handle purchase failure
    }
});


6. Handling Subscriptions

Start Subscription Process: Similar to purchases, subscriptions are initiated with:

iapHelper.startPayment(subscriptionId);

Check Subscription Status: After a user subscribes, you can check the subscription status:

iapHelper.checkSubscriptionStatus(productId);

Cancel, Revoke, or Refund Subscription:

Use APIs for managing subscription cancellations, refunds, or user revokes. For refund or cancel requests, you’ll need to follow the Samsung Seller Portal process.



7. Testing Your App

Test the IAP flow using Sandbox mode. Set the mode to testing:

SamsungIapHelper iapHelper = new SamsungIapHelper(this, SamsungIapHelper.IAP_MODE_TEST);

Test all purchase scenarios (e.g., success, failure, refund, subscription cancellation).


8. Publishing Your App

After setting up your products and implementing the IAP SDK, upload the final APK to the Samsung Galaxy Store.

Go to the Seller Portal, navigate to your app, and submit the APK for review.


9. Post-Publishing and Management

Once your app is live, you can:

Track sales and purchases via the Seller Portal.

Update products or prices without needing to update the app itself.

Handle refund requests directly via the Samsung Seller Portal.



10. IAP Best Practices

Secure purchases: Always validate purchase receipts on your server to prevent unauthorized access.

Grace periods for subscriptions: Handle cases where users miss payments or try to renew a subscription.

Refund management: Be transparent about refund policies.

This is a simple overview, so you can dive deeper into specific functionalities based on your project needs. Does this guide work for your app, or do you need more details on any specific section?

--------------

Let’s break it down in a super simple and user-friendly step-by-step guide to using Samsung IAP (for orders, publishing, and subscriptions). This guide assumes you’re working on an Android app and want to integrate Samsung In-App Purchases (IAP).


---

Step 1: Set Up Samsung IAP

1. Create Samsung Developer Account:

Go to Samsung Developer Portal and sign up.



2. Register Your App:

Go to Samsung Seller Portal and register your app.

Fill in the basic details about your app (name, description, etc.).

You will need to upload your APK (even if it’s just a placeholder).



3. Add Samsung IAP SDK to Your App:

Download and integrate the Samsung IAP SDK.

If using Android Studio, add the SDK library to your project.





---

Step 2: Prepare for IAP Integration

1. Add Billing Permission to Your App:

Open your AndroidManifest.xml and add this permission:

<uses-permission android:name="com.samsung.android.iap.permission.BILLING" />



2. Initialize the IAP in Your Code:

Use the SamsungIapHelper to connect your app to Samsung IAP.

SamsungIapHelper iapHelper = new SamsungIapHelper(this, SamsungIapHelper.IAP_MODE_PRODUCTION);



3. Choose What You Want to Sell:

You can sell three types of items:

Consumables (like game coins or extra lives).

Non-consumables (like ad-free versions or premium features).

Subscriptions (like monthly access to exclusive content).






---

Step 3: Set Up Your Products

1. Create Products in Samsung Seller Portal:

In Seller Portal, go to your app’s page, then to the In-App Products section.

Create a product and set its price, type (consumable, non-consumable, subscription), and product ID.


Example Product IDs:

Consumable: coins_100

Non-consumable: premium_upgrade

Subscription: monthly_subscription





---

Step 4: Implement IAP in Your App

1. Make Purchases Easy:

When a user taps "Buy", call the purchase function:

iapHelper.startPayment(productId); // Example: coins_100 or premium_upgrade



2. Handle Payment Responses:

If the payment succeeds or fails, handle it like this:

iapHelper.setOnPaymentListener(new OnPaymentListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPaymentSuccess(IapResult result) {
        // Give the user their product (coins, features, etc.)
    }
    @Override
    public void onPaymentFailed(IapResult result) {
        // Handle failure, show error message
    }
});





---

Step 5: Implement Subscriptions

1. Start Subscription:

For subscriptions, the flow is similar:

iapHelper.startPayment(subscriptionId); // Example: monthly_subscription



2. Check Subscription Status:

You can check if a user’s subscription is still active:

iapHelper.checkSubscriptionStatus(subscriptionId); // Check subscription





---

Step 6: Testing Before Publishing

1. Test in Sandbox Mode:

Switch to Test Mode:

SamsungIapHelper iapHelper = new SamsungIapHelper(this, SamsungIapHelper.IAP_MODE_TEST);



2. Test All Scenarios:

Test successful purchases, failures, and subscription renewals or cancellations to ensure everything works smoothly.





---

Step 7: Publish Your App

1. Upload Your Final APK:

Go back to Samsung Seller Portal, navigate to your app’s page, and submit the final APK.



2. Submit for Review:

Once your APK is uploaded, Samsung will review your app before publishing it on the Galaxy Store.





---

Step 8: Post-Publishing

1. Track Sales:

Once your app is live, monitor sales and purchases through the Samsung Seller Portal.



2. Update Products:

You can update product prices or add new items directly from the Seller Portal without changing your app’s code.



3. Handle Refunds:

If a user requests a refund, you can handle this directly through the Seller Portal.





---

Done! You now have a fully functional in-app purchase system in your app!


---

Recap

1. Set up your app in Samsung Developer Portal.
