### A Comprehensive Guide to Implementing Samsung IAP: Subscriptions, Purchases, Consumption, Cancellation, Revocation, and Refunds

Samsung In-App Purchase (IAP) offers developers a robust solution for handling digital transactions within mobile apps. Whether it’s selling digital goods, handling subscriptions, or managing refunds, Samsung IAP is designed to offer a smooth, secure experience. This blog post will guide you through the essential components of implementing Samsung IAP, including **subscriptions, purchases, consumption, cancellations, revocations**, and most importantly, **handling orders** (payments and refunds).

### Overview

Here’s what we’ll cover:
- **Subscriptions**: Managing recurring payments for digital goods or services.
- **Purchases**: Handling one-time purchases for digital items.
- **Consumption**: Marking a product as consumed.
- **Cancellation**: Managing user-initiated or developer-initiated cancellations.
- **Revocation**: Handling access revocation for digital items.
- **Refunds**: Processing user refund requests.

We'll focus especially on the **orders** portion, showing you how to view payment history and process refunds using the **Samsung IAP Orders API**.

## 1. Subscriptions

### How Subscriptions Work

Subscriptions allow users to pay on a recurring basis for content or services. A subscription can be set to auto-renew monthly, annually, or based on any time period you define. Users can manage or cancel their subscriptions through the Galaxy Store.

### Implementing Subscriptions

To implement subscriptions:
- **Add subscription products** in your **Galaxy Store Seller Portal**.
- **Use the IAP SDK** to initiate the purchase flow for subscription items.
  
Example code for initiating a subscription purchase:

```java
// Example subscription request
SamsungIapHelper.startPayment(
    context,
    "subscription_item_id",
    new PaymentListener() {
        @Override
        public void onPaymentSuccess(PurchaseData purchaseData) {
            // Handle successful subscription
        }

        @Override
        public void onPaymentFailure(PaymentError paymentError) {
            // Handle subscription failure
        }
    });
```

---

## 2. Purchases

### One-Time Purchases

For one-time purchases (like buying a book, unlocking a feature, etc.), the IAP SDK handles everything from user authentication to payment processing.

Example code for initiating a one-time purchase:

```java
SamsungIapHelper.startPayment(
    context,
    "product_item_id",
    new PaymentListener() {
        @Override
        public void onPaymentSuccess(PurchaseData purchaseData) {
            // Unlock the purchased content
        }

        @Override
        public void onPaymentFailure(PaymentError paymentError) {
            // Handle purchase failure
        }
    });
```

## 3. Consumption

### What is Consumption?

Once a consumable item (like coins or in-game currency) is purchased and used, it needs to be marked as "consumed" in the system to allow the user to purchase it again.

### Example of Consuming a Product:

```java
SamsungIapHelper.consumePurchase(
    context,
    purchaseData.getPurchaseId(),
    new ConsumptionListener() {
        @Override
        public void onConsumptionSuccess() {
            // Mark item as consumed
        }

        @Override
        public void onConsumptionFailure(PaymentError paymentError) {
            // Handle consumption failure
        }
    });
```

## 4. Cancellation

### Handling Cancellations

Users can cancel their subscriptions at any time through the Galaxy Store. You don’t need to handle this explicitly in your app, but you should be aware that once a subscription is canceled, access to the content should be revoked at the end of the billing cycle.

Samsung’s **Instant Server Notification (ISN)** can notify your server when a subscription is canceled, allowing you to respond by updating the user’s access.

---

## 5. Revocation

### What is Revocation?

Revocation occurs when a user’s access to purchased content is removed. This can happen due to various reasons, including policy violations or fraudulent purchases.

You can handle revocation through the **ISN**. Whenever Samsung sends a notification about a revoked product, you should update your app’s backend to revoke the user’s access.

## 6. Refunds

### Handling Refunds

Refunds are an essential part of maintaining user trust. Refund requests can be initiated by users through the Galaxy Store, or in some cases, you may need to handle refunds programmatically.

In the next section, we'll go deeper into **orders**, covering how to manage payments and refunds using the **Samsung IAP Orders API**.

## 7. Orders: Viewing Payments and Processing Refunds

The **Orders API** is crucial for tracking all payments and handling refunds within your app. It allows you to fetch all transactions within a specific time frame, check the status of purchases, and process refunds for users.

### Viewing All Payments

To view all payments for a specific period (for example, to display them in a history section within your app), you need to make a request to the **Orders API**.

#### API Endpoint:

- **URL**: `GET https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/orders`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  
- **Parameters**:
  - `startDate`: The start date for the payments you want to fetch (format: `yyyy-MM-dd`).
  - `endDate`: The end date for the payments (format: `yyyy-MM-dd`).
  - `status`: You can filter by transaction status (e.g., `Completed`, `Refunded`).

#### Example Request:

```java
public String getPayments(String accessToken, String startDate, String endDate) {
    OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
    String url = "https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/orders?startDate=" + startDate + "&endDate=" + endDate;

    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url(url)
        .addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken)
        .addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
        .build();

    try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
        if (response.isSuccessful()) {
            return response.body().string();
        } else {
            return "Error: " + response.code();
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### Response Example:

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "orderId": "123456",
      "itemTitle": "Premium Subscription",
      "usdPrice": "4.99",
      "purchaseDate": "2024-10-01",
      "status": "Completed"
    },
    {
      "orderId": "123457",
      "itemTitle": "E-Book Purchase",
      "usdPrice": "2.99",
      "purchaseDate": "2024-10-02",
      "status": "Refunded"
    }
  ]
}
```

This response contains all the relevant information about user purchases, such as the item title, price, and transaction status. You can store this data in a **SQLite** database or another storage solution for later use.

### Processing Refunds

Refunds can be processed programmatically using the **Refund API**. This is useful when a user requests a refund through your app, and you need to interact with Samsung IAP to process the refund.

#### API Endpoint:

- **URL**: `POST https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/refund`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`

#### Example Refund Request:

```java
public String processRefund(String accessToken, String purchaseId, String reason) {
    OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
    String url = "https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/refund";
    
    String jsonBody = "{\"purchaseId\":\"" + purchaseId + "\", \"reason\":\"" + reason + "\"}";
    RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(jsonBody, MediaType.get("application/json"));

    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url(url)
        .post(body)
        .addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken)
        .addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
        .build();

    try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
        if (response.isSuccessful()) {
            return response.body().string();
        } else {
            return "Error: " + response.code();
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return null;
    }
}
```

The **Refund API** allows you to programmatically process refunds by passing the purchase ID and a reason for the refund.
