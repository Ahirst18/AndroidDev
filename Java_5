Here’s a super simple step-by-step guide to implement orders in Samsung IAP using SQLite, call the API with Retrofit, and show orders in RecyclerView:


---

Step 1: Set Up SQLite to Store Orders

1. Create a Database:

Use SQLite to create a database table called Orders to store purchase info.

The table should have columns for:

Order ID

Product ID (what they bought)

Order Date

Order Status (pending, completed)




2. Save Order Details:

When a purchase happens, save the order in this database with a status of “pending.”





---

Step 2: Call API Using Retrofit

1. Set Up Retrofit:

Use Retrofit to connect your app to a server or API.

Define an endpoint where you can send the order details stored in SQLite.



2. Send Orders to Server:

After saving the order in SQLite, use Retrofit to send the order data to the server or API.

Once the server confirms, update the order status in SQLite to "completed."

Step 3: Display Orders in RecyclerView

1. Get Orders from SQLite:

Retrieve all saved orders from the SQLite database (pending, completed, etc.).



2. Show Orders in RecyclerView:

Use a RecyclerView to display the list of orders.

Each item should show:

Product name

Order date

Order status (pending/completed)






---

Step 4: Update Orders and RecyclerView

1. Update Order Status:

When the order is successfully sent to the server, update the status to "completed" in SQLite.



2. Refresh RecyclerView:

Notify RecyclerView to refresh and show the updated order status.

Step 5: Handle Pending Orders

1. Retry Sending Pending Orders:

If some orders couldn’t be sent (due to no internet, etc.), mark them as "pending."

Retry sending pending orders when the user is back online.





---

Summary

Save orders in SQLite when a purchase is made.

Send orders to the server using Retrofit.

Display orders in RecyclerView.

Update and refresh RecyclerView when the order status changes.


This is an easy-to-follow process that can help you manage in-app purchase orders and display them effectively!
