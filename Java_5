# Implementing Samsung IAP Orders: Viewing Payments and Handling Refunds

With Samsung In-App Purchase (IAP), developers can easily manage transactions, offering a seamless experience for users purchasing digital goods within apps. In this blog, we’ll explore how to use the **Samsung IAP Orders API** to view all payments and handle refunds for a specific date.

## Overview

The **Orders API** is essential for retrieving users’ payment histories and processing refunds. In this post, we will cover:

1. **Fetching all payments** for a specific period.
2. **Handling refunds** programmatically using the API.

By the end, you’ll be able to query payments, verify purchases, and process refunds in your app with confidence.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have:

- **Samsung IAP SDK** integrated into your app.
- **Galaxy Store Seller Account**.
- **Samsung Account** with API keys to access the IAP services.
- **Backend Server** to securely handle API calls (Spring Boot or other framework).
  
For more details on the initial setup, refer to the [Samsung IAP Setup Guide](https://developer.samsung.com/iap).

## Step 1: Understanding the Orders API

The **Orders API** allows developers to view user purchases, process refunds, and check the status of transactions. Here's a breakdown of the API endpoints we’ll use:

1. **View All Payments**: Fetch all purchases made within a specific date range.
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /iap/v6/orders`
   - **Parameters**: `startDate`, `endDate`, `status`
  
2. **Process Refunds**: Request a refund for a specific transaction.
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /iap/v6/refund`
   - **Parameters**: `purchaseId`, `reason`

## Step 2: Fetching All Payments for a Specific Date

To fetch the order details for a specific date or range, you’ll need to make an authenticated API request. Here's how you can implement it:

### API Request

- **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/orders`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `startDate`: Start date of the range (format: `yyyy-MM-dd`).
  - `endDate`: End date of the range (format: `yyyy-MM-dd`).
  - `status`: Transaction status (`Completed`, `Refunded`, `Failed`, etc.).

### Example Request:

```java
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient;
import okhttp3.Request;
import okhttp3.Response;

public class SamsungIAPClient {

    private static final String BASE_URL = "https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/orders";
    
    public String getOrders(String accessToken, String startDate, String endDate) throws IOException {
        OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

        String url = BASE_URL + "?startDate=" + startDate + "&endDate=" + endDate;

        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url(url)
                .addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken)
                .addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
                .build();

        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
            if (response.isSuccessful()) {
                return response.body().string();
            } else {
                return "Error: " + response.code() + " " + response.message();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling the Response

The response will contain a list of orders made within the specified date range. Here's a sample response:

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "orderId": "12345",
      "itemTitle": "Book A",
      "usdPrice": "4.99",
      "purchaseDate": "2024-10-01",
      "status": "Completed"
    },
    {
      "orderId": "67890",
      "itemTitle": "Book B",
      "usdPrice": "3.99",
      "purchaseDate": "2024-10-02",
      "status": "Refunded"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can now display this data to users or process it on the backend to analyze sales, handle accounting, etc.

## Step 3: Handling Refunds Programmatically

The next step is to process refunds for specific transactions using the **Refund API**. 

### API Request

- **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/refund`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  
- **Body Parameters**:
  - `purchaseId`: The unique ID of the purchase to be refunded.
  - `reason`: The reason for the refund request.

### Example Request:

```java
import okhttp3.MediaType;
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient;
import okhttp3.Request;
import okhttp3.RequestBody;
import okhttp3.Response;

public class SamsungIAPClient {

    private static final String REFUND_URL = "https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/refund";

    public String processRefund(String accessToken, String purchaseId, String reason) throws IOException {
        OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

        MediaType JSON = MediaType.get("application/json; charset=utf-8");
        String jsonBody = "{ \"purchaseId\": \"" + purchaseId + "\", \"reason\": \"" + reason + "\" }";
        RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(jsonBody, JSON);

        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url(REFUND_URL)
                .post(body)
                .addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken)
                .addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
                .build();

        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
            if (response.isSuccessful()) {
                return response.body().string();
            } else {
                return "Error: " + response.code() + " " + response.message();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling Refund Responses

The response to a refund request will indicate whether the refund was processed successfully. A successful refund response might look like this:

```json
{
  "status": "Refunded",
  "refundDate": "2024-10-03",
  "orderId": "12345",
  "usdPrice": "4.99"
}
```

If the refund is unsuccessful, the API will return an error message, allowing you to handle the failure appropriately.
