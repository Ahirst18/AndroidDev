In Samsung In-App Purchase (IAP), an order refers to a purchase transaction that users make within an app. When a user wants to buy a subscription, digital item, or any in-app product, an order is created. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the order process in Samsung IAP and how it works:

1. Initialization

Before any purchase can occur, the app must initialize Samsung IAP. This is done using the init method. It checks if the IAP service is available and establishes a connection between your app and the Samsung billing system.

Initialization Process:

Call the init method from Samsung IAP.

Samsung checks if the user has a valid Samsung Account and if the device supports IAP.

If the initialization is successful, the app can proceed with purchasing flow; otherwise, the app will need to handle errors such as unsupported device or unavailability of IAP.


2. Displaying Available Products

Once initialized, your app can fetch the list of in-app products, such as:

One-time purchases (e.g., buying digital content)

Subscriptions (e.g., weekly, monthly subscriptions)


Product List Fetching:

The app sends a request to Samsung IAP to retrieve all available products.

The IAP server responds with the details of each product (product ID, price, currency, etc.).


This allows you to show the user all the products they can purchase, along with their pricing and descriptions.

3. Order Creation (Purchase Request)

When a user selects a product to buy, an order is created by initiating a purchase request.

How It Works:

The app sends a purchase request using the startPayment API, which includes the product ID of the item the user wants to buy.

Samsung IAP processes the request by confirming the user's payment information (e.g., via Samsung Pay, carrier billing, credit card, etc.).

The user is presented with a checkout screen to confirm the payment.


Types of Products:

Consumable: Items that can be purchased multiple times (e.g., virtual currency).

Non-consumable: Items that are purchased once and owned permanently (e.g., removing ads).

Subscriptions: Recurring payments for accessing services or content.


4. Payment Confirmation and Validation

After the user confirms the purchase and the payment is processed, Samsung IAP returns an order ID and receipt to the app.

Steps:

The payment is processed, and if successful, Samsung returns a receipt and transaction details (order ID, purchase time, etc.).

The app needs to verify the purchase receipt by sending the order ID to Samsung’s IAP server for validation (server-side validation).


This validation step is crucial to ensure that the purchase was legitimate and to avoid fraud.

5. Delivering the Product

Once the receipt is validated, the app can unlock the purchased content for the user (e.g., credits, items, access to premium features).

Process:

If it’s a consumable product, the user gets the item (e.g., virtual currency).

If it’s a non-consumable product, the app unlocks the purchased content (e.g., premium features).

For subscriptions, access to the content/service is granted for the duration of the subscription (e.g., monthly or yearly).


6. Handling Subscription Renewals and Cancellations

For subscription-based products, the Samsung IAP system handles the recurring billing process.

Automatic Renewals:

Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of the billing cycle unless the user cancels.

Samsung sends renewal notifications and updates the order status accordingly.


Cancellation/Refund:

Users can cancel subscriptions anytime, but access remains available until the end of the current billing period.

Samsung also provides mechanisms to revoke or refund orders in case of issues.


7. Checking Order Status

The app can check the status of a previous order using the getPurchaseList API, which retrieves the list of purchases and their statuses (e.g., active, expired, refunded, etc.).

Order Statuses:

Completed: The payment was successful, and the item was delivered.

Pending: The order is waiting for user confirmation or additional processing.

Failed: The order couldn’t be completed due to a payment issue.

Refunded: The payment was refunded to the user.


Summary of the Flow:

1. Initialization → Check IAP availability.


2. Product Query → Display list of available products.


3. Order Creation → User selects a product and starts payment.


4. Payment Processing → Samsung IAP handles payment.


5. Receipt Validation → Validate the receipt and order ID.


6. Product Delivery → Unlock or deliver the purchased product.


7. Subscription Handling → Manage renewals, cancellations, and refunds.


8. Check Order Status → Retrieve the status of a user's past purchases.



This entire flow ensures a seamless and secure in-app purchasing experience.
