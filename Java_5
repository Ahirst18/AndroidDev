# Implementing Samsung IAP Orders: Viewing Payments and Handling Refunds

With Samsung In-App Purchase (IAP), developers can easily manage transactions, offering a seamless experience for users purchasing digital goods within apps. In this blog, we’ll explore how to use the **Samsung IAP Orders API** to view all payments and handle refunds for a specific date.

## Overview

The **Orders API** is essential for retrieving users’ payment histories and processing refunds. In this post, we will cover:

1. **Fetching all payments** for a specific period.
2. **Handling refunds** programmatically using the API.

By the end, you’ll be able to query payments, verify purchases, and process refunds in your app with confidence.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have:

- **Samsung IAP SDK** integrated into your app.
- **Galaxy Store Seller Account**.
- **Samsung Account** with API keys to access the IAP services.
- **Backend Server** to securely handle API calls (Spring Boot or other framework).
  
For more details on the initial setup, refer to the [Samsung IAP Setup Guide](https://developer.samsung.com/iap).

## Step 1: Understanding the Orders API

The **Orders API** allows developers to view user purchases, process refunds, and check the status of transactions. Here's a breakdown of the API endpoints we’ll use:

1. **View All Payments**: Fetch all purchases made within a specific date range.
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /iap/v6/orders`
   - **Parameters**: `startDate`, `endDate`, `status`
  
2. **Process Refunds**: Request a refund for a specific transaction.
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /iap/v6/refund`
   - **Parameters**: `purchaseId`, `reason`

---

## Step 2: Fetching All Payments for a Specific Date

To fetch the order details for a specific date or range, you’ll need to make an authenticated API request. Here's how you can implement it:

### API Request

- **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/orders`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `startDate`: Start date of the range (format: `yyyy-MM-dd`).
  - `endDate`: End date of the range (format: `yyyy-MM-dd`).
  - `status`: Transaction status (`Completed`, `Refunded`, `Failed`, etc.).

### Example Request:

```java
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient;
import okhttp3.Request;
import okhttp3.Response;

public class SamsungIAPClient {

    private static final String BASE_URL = "https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/orders";
    
    public String getOrders(String accessToken, String startDate, String endDate) throws IOException {
        OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

        String url = BASE_URL + "?startDate=" + startDate + "&endDate=" + endDate;

        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url(url)
                .addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken)
                .addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
                .build();

        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
            if (response.isSuccessful()) {
                return response.body().string();
            } else {
                return "Error: " + response.code() + " " + response.message();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling the Response

The response will contain a list of orders made within the specified date range. Here's a sample response:

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "orderId": "12345",
      "itemTitle": "Book A",
      "usdPrice": "4.99",
      "purchaseDate": "2024-10-01",
      "status": "Completed"
    },
    {
      "orderId": "67890",
      "itemTitle": "Book B",
      "usdPrice": "3.99",
      "purchaseDate": "2024-10-02",
      "status": "Refunded"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can now display this data to users or process it on the backend to analyze sales, handle accounting, etc.

## Step 3: Handling Refunds Programmatically

The next step is to process refunds for specific transactions using the **Refund API**. 

### API Request

- **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/refund`
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  
- **Body Parameters**:
  - `purchaseId`: The unique ID of the purchase to be refunded.
  - `reason`: The reason for the refund request.

### Example Request:

```java
import okhttp3.MediaType;
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient;
import okhttp3.Request;
import okhttp3.RequestBody;
import okhttp3.Response;

public class SamsungIAPClient {

    private static final String REFUND_URL = "https://api.galaxyapps.com/iap/v6/refund";

    public String processRefund(String accessToken, String purchaseId, String reason) throws IOException {
        OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

        MediaType JSON = MediaType.get("application/json; charset=utf-8");
        String jsonBody = "{ \"purchaseId\": \"" + purchaseId + "\", \"reason\": \"" + reason + "\" }";
        RequestBody body = RequestBody.create(jsonBody, JSON);

        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url(REFUND_URL)
                .post(body)
                .addHeader("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken)
                .addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
                .build();

        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
            if (response.isSuccessful()) {
                return response.body().string();
            } else {
                return "Error: " + response.code() + " " + response.message();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling Refund Responses

The response to a refund request will indicate whether the refund was processed successfully. A successful refund response might look like this:

```json
{
  "status": "Refunded",
  "refundDate": "2024-10-03",
  "orderId": "12345",
  "usdPrice": "4.99"
}
```

If the refund is unsuccessful, the API will return an error message, allowing you to handle the failure appropriately.

Yes, you can absolutely use **SQLite** to store payment and refund data locally on the user's device. It's a lightweight, relational database perfect for mobile apps when you need to manage data efficiently without setting up a remote server. Here’s how you can include SQLite as your database solution in the blog:

## Step 4: Storing Payment and Refund Data Locally with SQLite

For mobile applications, storing payment and refund data locally using **SQLite** is a great option. SQLite is embedded in Android, making it easy to manage relational data without the need for an external server.

### Setting Up SQLite in Android

To store payments and refund data using SQLite, follow these steps:

1. **Create SQLite Database**:
   You need to create tables to store both payment and refund data.

### Example Payment Table:

```java
public class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {
    private static final String DATABASE_NAME = "PaymentsDB";
    private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1;

    // Table Names
    private static final String TABLE_PAYMENTS = "Payments";
    private static final String TABLE_REFUNDS = "Refunds";

    // Payments Table Columns
    private static final String COLUMN_ID = "id";
    private static final String COLUMN_ORDER_ID = "orderId";
    private static final String COLUMN_ITEM_TITLE = "itemTitle";
    private static final String COLUMN_PRICE = "usdPrice";
    private static final String COLUMN_PURCHASE_DATE = "purchaseDate";
    private static final String COLUMN_STATUS = "status";

    // Refunds Table Columns
    private static final String COLUMN_REFUND_DATE = "refundDate";
    private static final String COLUMN_REFUND_AMOUNT = "refundAmount";
    private static final String COLUMN_REASON = "reason";

    public DatabaseHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
        String CREATE_PAYMENTS_TABLE = "CREATE TABLE " + TABLE_PAYMENTS + "("
                + COLUMN_ID + " INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,"
                + COLUMN_ORDER_ID + " TEXT,"
                + COLUMN_ITEM_TITLE + " TEXT,"
                + COLUMN_PRICE + " REAL,"
                + COLUMN_PURCHASE_DATE + " TEXT,"
                + COLUMN_STATUS + " TEXT" + ")";
        db.execSQL(CREATE_PAYMENTS_TABLE);

        String CREATE_REFUNDS_TABLE = "CREATE TABLE " + TABLE_REFUNDS + "("
                + COLUMN_ID + " INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,"
                + COLUMN_ORDER_ID + " TEXT,"
                + COLUMN_REFUND_DATE + " TEXT,"
                + COLUMN_REFUND_AMOUNT + " REAL,"
                + COLUMN_REASON + " TEXT" + ")";
        db.execSQL(CREATE_REFUNDS_TABLE);
    }

    @Override
    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
        db.execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS " + TABLE_PAYMENTS);
        db.execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS " + TABLE_REFUNDS);
        onCreate(db);
    }
}
```

### Inserting Payment and Refund Data:

You can store data in these tables after receiving it from the Samsung IAP API:

- **Inserting Payment Data**:

```java
public void insertPayment(String orderId, String itemTitle, double price, String purchaseDate, String status) {
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
    ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
    values.put("orderId", orderId);
    values.put("itemTitle", itemTitle);
    values.put("usdPrice", price);
    values.put("purchaseDate", purchaseDate);
    values.put("status", status);
    
    db.insert("Payments", null, values);
    db.close();
}
```

- **Inserting Refund Data**:

```java
public void insertRefund(String orderId, String refundDate, double refundAmount, String reason) {
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
    ContentValues values = new ContentValues();
    values.put("orderId", orderId);
    values.put("refundDate", refundDate);
    values.put("refundAmount", refundAmount);
    values.put("reason", reason);
    
    db.insert("Refunds", null, values);
    db.close();
}
```

### Retrieving Payment and Refund Data:

You can query the SQLite database to retrieve all payments and refunds:

```java
public Cursor getPayments() {
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getReadableDatabase();
    return db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM Payments", null);
}

public Cursor getRefunds() {
    SQLiteDatabase db = this.getReadableDatabase();
    return db.rawQuery("SELECT * FROM Refunds", null);
}
```

### Benefits of Using SQLite:

- **Offline Access**: Payment and refund data is available offline, which is helpful for users with intermittent network access.
- **Fast Data Access**: Queries on SQLite are lightweight and fast for smaller datasets.
- **No Backend Required**: Great for apps that do not need to sync all transaction data to the cloud.

### When to Sync with Server:

Although SQLite is great for local storage, syncing data with a backend server periodically or using Samsung **Instant Server Notification (ISN)** will help you keep transaction records up to date.

---

With this SQLite setup, you can now manage payment and refund data efficiently on the user’s device, giving your app a reliable way to track purchases even when the user is offline.



## Conclusion

Integrating Samsung IAP Orders and Refunds functionality into your app is an essential step in managing user transactions and ensuring a seamless purchase experience. By implementing the **Orders API**, you can easily track all payments and handle refunds for specific transactions.
