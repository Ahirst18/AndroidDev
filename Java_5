Here’s a detailed implementation guide for integrating Samsung IAP’s Instant Server Notification (ISN) with your Java-based Android app using Android Studio. This involves both the app and server-side configuration.

Step 1: Setting Up Your Server for ISN

Before integrating ISN with your Android app, you need a server to handle notifications from Samsung. This server should be capable of receiving POST requests.

1. Set Up a Web Server:

Deploy a server using any backend technology (Node.js, Java Spring Boot, PHP, Python Flask, etc.).

Ensure your server supports HTTPS, as Samsung only sends notifications over secure connections.



2. Define Your Endpoint:

Create an API endpoint that Samsung will call. For example, https://yourserver.com/samsung_iap_isn.



3. Handle POST Requests:

Your endpoint must be able to handle incoming POST requests with JSON data from Samsung.


Here’s a sample implementation using Java with Spring Boot:

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/iap")
public class SamsungIAPController {

    @PostMapping("/isn")
    public ResponseEntity<String> receiveISN(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> payload) {
        // Log the received payload
        System.out.println("Received ISN payload: " + payload);

        // Extract necessary information
        String purchaseId = (String) payload.get("purchaseId");
        String status = (String) payload.get("status");

        // Process the notification based on the status (e.g., 'ACTIVE', 'EXPIRED', 'CANCELED')
        switch (status) {
            case "ACTIVE":
                // Handle active subscription
                break;
            case "EXPIRED":
                // Handle expired subscription
                break;
            case "CANCELED":
                // Handle canceled subscription
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Unknown status received: " + status);
                break;
        }

        // Send a 200 OK response back to Samsung
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Notification received");
    }
}

This example uses the Spring Boot framework to handle POST requests to /iap/isn.


4. Verify the Authenticity:

You need to implement a security check using the verifySignature field provided in the JSON payload from Samsung to ensure the request is genuine.




Step 2: Register Your ISN URL with Samsung IAP

1. Access the Samsung IAP Developer Portal:

Log in to Samsung IAP Seller Portal with your developer account.



2. Register Your App:

Go to "Applications" → Select your app or create a new one.



3. Set the ISN URL:

Go to "Monetization" → "In-App Purchase" → "Instant Server Notification".

Enter your server’s ISN URL (e.g., https://yourserver.com/iap/isn) and save the changes.




Step 3: Implement IAP in Your Android App

1. Add Samsung IAP SDK to Your Project

Add the Samsung IAP library to your build.gradle file:

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.sec.android.iap:iap:5.1.0'
}

2. Initialize Samsung IAP in Your App

Create a class to manage Samsung IAP:

public class SamsungIapHelper {
    private static final int REQUEST_CODE = 1001; // Unique request code
    private Activity activity;

    public SamsungIapHelper(Activity activity) {
        this.activity = activity;
    }

    public void initializeIap() {
        IapHelper iapHelper = new IapHelper(activity, REQUEST_CODE);
        iapHelper.setOperationMode(IapHelper.OperationMode.OPERATION_MODE_PRODUCTION);
    }

    public void startPurchase(String productId) {
        IapHelper iapHelper = new IapHelper(activity, REQUEST_CODE);
        iapHelper.startPurchase(productId);
    }

    public void handleActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        if (requestCode == REQUEST_CODE) {
            IapHelper iapHelper = new IapHelper(activity, REQUEST_CODE);
            iapHelper.handlePurchaseResult(data);
        }
    }
}

Step 4: Handling the IAP Purchase Status in Your App

1. Implement the logic to handle purchase states:

You can check the status of purchases locally within the app, but it's crucial to synchronize with your server using ISN notifications to manage user access.




Integrate Samsung IAP into Your Activity

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private SamsungIapHelper samsungIapHelper;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        samsungIapHelper = new SamsungIapHelper(this);
        samsungIapHelper.initializeIap();
    }

    public void onPurchaseButtonClick(View view) {
        String productId = "your_product_id"; // The product ID to purchase
        samsungIapHelper.startPurchase(productId);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        samsungIapHelper.handleActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    }
}

Step 5: Testing ISN and Samsung IAP Integration

1. Test in a development environment:

Ensure you use test products and Samsung accounts to avoid real charges during testing.



2. Simulate ISN:

You can use tools like Postman to send test POST requests to your server’s endpoint to ensure it handles the notifications correctly.




Important Points to Note

Security: Implement signature validation to authenticate incoming ISN notifications.

Database Updates: Store purchase details in your database to manage user access and subscription status efficiently.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for network errors, failed purchases, and other scenarios.
